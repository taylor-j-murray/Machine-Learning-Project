We start by setting ``'id'`` as the index for a copy of the data base as the values of the ``'id'`` feature are unique and contain no N/A values; hence, the values in ``'id'`` serve as unique identifiers.

Likely, this is some sort of value error- a good indicator is that the 75th quantile $\\$1,395$ per month. We will deal with high values like this via outlier detection. One possible argument is that high values like this may be the total cost of a house rather than the price per month; however, this too is unlikely as $2,768,307,249$ is in the billions.\n",
    "* In the ``'sqfeet'`` column there is a minimum value of $0 ~\\mathrm{ft}^2$. We will assume instances with a square footage of $ 0 ~\\mathrm{ft}^2$ represent bad data and delete such instances\n",
    "* In the ``'sqfeet'`` column there is a maximum value of $ 8388607 ~\\mathrm{ft}^2 $. Likely this is some sort of data entry error as a quick google search shows that the house with the largest square footage has $178,926~\\mathrm{ft}^2$.\n",
    "* In the ``'beds'`` column there is a minimum value of $0$ beds. We will assume instances with $0$ beds represent bad data and delete such instances.\n",
    "* In the ``'beds'`` column there is a maximum value of $1100$ beds. Likely this represents bad data and such instances will be dealt with via outlier detection.\n",

It is important to note here that values in the ``'laundry_options'`` and ``'parking_options'`` have 7 and 8 unique values, respectively. Moreover, both ``'laundry_options'`` and ``'parking_options'`` contain a ``no laundry on site`` and ``no parking`` value, respectively, so an na value in either of these columns **does not mean** that there is no laundry or parking options, just that it is truly unknown. \n",
